Gatling with Github Actions
=========================

### CI (WIP not working for now) [![(CI) Build gatling docker image](https://github.com/JulienBouchardIT/Gatling-on-GithubActions/actions/workflows/CI-buildDocker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JulienBouchardIT/Gatling-on-GithubActions/actions/workflows/CI-buildDocker.yml) 

I cant figure out how to do that part for now

### CT (Include CI for now)) [![(CT) Launch a simulation](https://github.com/JulienBouchardIT/Gatling-on-GithubActions/actions/workflows/CT-runSimulation.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JulienBouchardIT/Gatling-on-GithubActions/actions/workflows/CT-runSimulation.yml)



The only usable simulation in this exemple is [BasicTest](https://github.com/JulienBouchardIT/Gatling-on-GithubActions/blob/master/src/test/scala/BasicTest.scala)
